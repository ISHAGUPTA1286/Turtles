## What is it about:

A neo4j graph which is collection of different algorithms and connecting them and showing them on the basis of difficulty (time based).  

It can show the pre-knowledge required to learn a particular topic and also provides the resources for it.


## Steps to run the program:

1. Clone the github repo: https://github.com/samruddhishastri/Turtles.git

2. Now download the neo4j in your system 

	for ubuntu 18.04 version refer this: https://www.techunits.com/topics/setup-guides/setup-guide-for-neo4j-graph-database-ubuntu-18-04-lts/

3. After setting up neo4j, copy the code from Backend/basic.cypher and paste it to input box of http://localhost:7474/browser/ site (if multiple line is not enabled you must get an error, enable it from the settings).

4. Press run (button) and then 

```
      match (n) return n
```

5. You can see the graph.
